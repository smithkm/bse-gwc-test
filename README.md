To install ruby dependencies

````
bundle install
````


To run a test (`testGridset.yml` in this case)
````
ruby testGridset.yml
````

If you get a `missing config values` error, edit `config.yml` to set the needed parameters.  Defaults will be injected but they may just be messages telling you what you put in and even usable defaults should be checked before running again.
